# Quickstart guide

Speedrunning is a great way to continue playing Claw after you have already played the game normally. This guide will explain how to get set up for speedrunning the game, and record your first run. Everything used here is free and wonâ€™t take long to install.

 - Install [Claw 1.4.4.4](https://captainclaw.net/dl/CLAW-1.4.4.4.zip) (Other versions may be compatible but haven't been tested)
 - Install [Livesplit](http://livesplit.org/downloads/) - for timing runs
 - Install [Autohotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) - For creating hotkeys and remapping buttons
 - Download [Basic Speedrun Hotkeys](https://www.speedrun.com/tools/Claw_Speedrun_Hotkeys_Basic_3y9m5.lss) - Hotkey to toggle in-game timer and FPS
 - Recommended: Join [Claw Discord](https://discord.gg/2GCj9hj) - Ask in the #speedrun channel for help
 - Recommended: Download [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/download) - to record runs
 
 Note that there are alternatives to some of these if you prefer, but this guide will assume usage of the software listed above.
 
 ## Timing runs
 
 Runs are timed using Livesplit, accurate to 1/100th of a second, so you should always have Livesplit timer running when recording runs. Open Livesplit, right click it and go to settings. Choose hotkeys for start/split and reset. 
 
 For full game runs, timing starts when you select new game on La Roca, and ends when you touch the last Gem on the Omar boss fight. For Individual Level (IL) runs, timing starts on the first frame that the screen goes black after the loading screen, and ends when you touch the end of level trigger, or the red boss warp if the level has one.
 
 The in game timer is not actually used for timing runs, because it is only accurate to 1 second and pauses in some situations, such as using warps, dying, and when the game is paused. It is still very helpful to have it visible during runs, because you can use it to tell where elevators and ropes etc. will be even before they are on screen. While in a level, type MPSTOPWATCH to toggle the timer. Since you can't type this during a run, you need a hotkey to toggle it for you. With Autohotkey installed, run the `Claw_Speedrun_Hotkeys_Basic.lss` file downloaded above, and then press CapsLock while in a level to toggle the timer and FPS. The best time to press this is just before Claw can move, at the start of your run.
 
## Framerate (FPS)

Your Frames per Second (FPS) in Claw can have a big effect on how the game feels to play. While in a level, type MPFPS to view framerate. A framerate of 60FPS is required in order for speedruns to be valid on the leaderboards, although if you are unable to achieve this framerate, you can still have fun with more casual speedrunning. Lower framerates can slow movement and cut jumps short, and higher framerate will speed up movement, slows down some elevators, and makes dynamite jumping harder. Since FPS is useful for run verification, the FPS counter is enabled with the in game timer using the CapsLock hotkey from the `Claw_Speedrun_Hotkeys_Basic.lss` file downloaded above.

## Key bindings

It's worth thinking about key bindings sooner rather than later, since it is hard to change once you are used to a certain layout. The default controls are usable for speedrunning, but it's recommended to have separate buttons for magic claw, pistol and dynamite which are easy to reach, rather than using shift to cycle between them.

Also, you may want to use WASD for movement, although you can't remap the movement keys in the game. You can use autohotkey or similar to do this remapping. Using WASD may be better for right handed players because then jumping (probably the most precise inputs) can be done with the dominant hand, although keeping the original arrow buttons for movement is also fine.
 
## Recording a run

OBS Studio can be used to record speedruns, there are plenty of guides online for how to set this up, so it won't be covered in detail here. For an example very basic setup:

- Run OBS Studio, Claw and Livesplit
- In OBS, add a new 'Scene' called 'Claw', then select it
- In 'Sources', add a new game capture called 'Claw'. Choose mode 'Capture specific window' and select the claw window
- In 'Sources'. and a new window capture called 'Livesplit', and select the Livesplit window
- In OBS, rearange and resize Claw and Livesplit to how you want the layout to be in the recording
- Click 'Settings' and choose the recording settings you want

The official rules for recording a valid run can be found on [speedrun.com](https://www.speedrun.com/claw).

## First speedrun - La Roca

La Roca is a good first speedrun since it is short and the enemies die in one hit, an example run can be seen [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQPaYqKf-6o), and there is also a [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqWTx-3ZFT4). There are two key cycles in the middle of the level that will make a big difference to your final time. Firstly there is the pair of elevators that go up and down, the fastest possible is to arrive at the left side of these at 0:37 on the in game timer, although this is quite advanced. For new speerunners a good target is to arrive at the right side at 0:40, we call this the 'second cycle'. The other key cycle is the three toggle pegs just after this. With perfect movement it is possible to reach these at 0:45, but this is very difficult. For a new speedrunner, a good target is 0:53, which is the third cycle. If you get these cycles, a good final time would be a 1:25 or 1:26 on the in game timer (about 1:28 on livesplit timer).

## Next steps

If you want to go further with Claw speedrunning, this repository contains more tools for speedrunning, including:

- Livesplit layout files so that it is more that just a basic timer
- Livesplit splits files for every level and the full game
- Livesplit autosplitters (so that the timer starts, stops and splits automatically) for every level and the full game
- A set of Claw icons, used in the livesplit splits files
- A more detailed Autohotkey file that includes hotkeys for some cheat codes that are useful for practicing
- Instructions on how to use the livesplit and autohotkey files
- Dynamite jump guide (coming soon...)

For the latest stratgies for each level, you can watch runs on the speedrun leaderboards, see the links below.
